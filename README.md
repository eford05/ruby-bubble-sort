# ruby-bubble-sort

This project is my take on how I would solve the Bubble Sort problem, at my current level of understanding.

# The Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort method takes an array of integers as a parameter, it iterates over the array starting from 0 to the full length of the array. It compares the adjacent indices and swaps them so that they are in the correct ascending order.

# My Plan

- Iterate over the array
- Store temp variable for the previous index and swap with the current if necessary
- Return new array
